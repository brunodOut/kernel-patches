Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] staging: vme: Cleanup driver tree old structures

This patch series modify the vme_user driver's place in
menuconfig (1/3), fixes a missing `depends on` line in a Kconfig file
(2/3), and rearrages the directory tree for the driver allowing a more
straightforward comprehension of its contents (3/3).

The 'vme_user/' driver is the only remaining vme-family driver in the
'staging/' tree, but its structure, entry in menuconfig and building
routines are still attached to the 'vme/' subtree now outside
'staging/'. The present patchset fixes it.

  Created PATCH 1/3 as a single patch
v2:
  Added PATCH 2/3 and 3/3, turning it into a patchset

  Fixed and improved commit messages according to previous comments by

  imperative tense as for Alison's suggestions. The message body got
  fixed according to Greg formatting comments. The changelogs were moved
  to the cover letter as per another suggestion by Alison, and I added
  missing details (like the update in the MAINTAINERS I failed to
  mention in v2) and made textual improvements for clarity that I also
  noticed.
