Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] staging: vme: Cleanup driver tree old structures

This patch series modify the vme_user driver's place in
menuconfig (1/3), fixes a missing `depends on` line in a Kconfig file
(2/3), and rearrages the directory tree for the driver allowing a more
straightforward comprehension of its contents (3/3).

The 'vme_user/' driver is the only remaining vme-family driver in the
'staging/' tree, but its structure, entry in menuconfig and building
routines are still attached to the 'vme/' subtree now outside
'staging/'. The present patchset fixes it.
