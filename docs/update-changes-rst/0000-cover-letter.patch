Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] Docs: Update information at changes.rst

Add and update information at 'Documentation/process/changes.rst'. The
text has outdated kernel version and misses the 'cpio' build
requirement, necessary for the `kernel/gen_kheaders.sh` script called by
the install target.

The PATCH 1/2 fixes the missing cpio requirement, while PATCH 2/2 fixes
the kernel version reference.
